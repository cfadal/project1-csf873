      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Christian Fadal, a <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> student at Texas A&M University. Explore my portfolio, skills, and qualifications.</p>
      <p>
        My interests include ARM architecture, Verilog processor design, and efficient system-level programming. I love team-focused challenges and bring a great mindset for finding solutions!
      </p>
      <p>I am from Houston, Texas and have always had an interest in technology. Ever since I was a kid, I was always involving myself in the newest tech that was released at the time. I've always had a hobby with gaming and still currently do, except now I'm more interested on how the games run, how they are coded, and even the graphic design department as well.
        I'd say the ability to code the graphics and implement them in a game that multiple people can access at once is the most fascinating thing to me. I'm constantly thinking about new possible ideas for designs and I am positive I would be a great addition to any team that needs these types of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>Some areas of graphic design that I am currently interested in are User Interface Design, Web Design, and like I said previously, Game Design. For UI design specifically, I enjoy making things easier for the user. I believe that a well constructed UI is a necessity when making a website, mobile device, a software, etc.
        Being able to give the user a more enjoyable experience when using a product will lead to more success. My interests with Web Design fall under the same philosophies about making it easy for the users. And for Game Design, I think video games today are becoming so much more realistic with the new graphic design engines being created. The difference of graphical game design
        from 15 years ago to today is a night and day difference, and I find it incredibly intriguing.
